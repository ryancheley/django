Django 5.0.1 release notes
==========================

*Expected January 2, 2024*

Django 5.0.1 fixes several bugs in 5.0.

Bugfixes
========

* Reallowed, following a regression in Django 5.0, using a foreign key to a
  model with a primary key that is not ``AutoField`` in
  :attr:`.ModelAdmin.list_filter` (:ticket:`35020`).

* Fixed a long standing bug in handling the ``RETURNING INTO`` clause that
  caused a crash when creating a model instance with a ``GeneratedField`` which
  ``output_field`` had backend-specific converters (:ticket:`35024`).
