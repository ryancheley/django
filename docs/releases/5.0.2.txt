Django 5.0.2 release notes
==========================

*February 6, 2024*

Django 5.0.2 fixes a security issue with severity "moderate" and several bugs
in 5.0.1. Also, the latest string translations from Transifex are incorporated.

Bugfixes
========

* Reallowed, following a regression in Django 5.0.1, filtering against local
  foreign keys not included in :attr:`.ModelAdmin.list_filter`
  (:ticket:`35087`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 where links in the admin had an incorrect
  color (:ticket:`35121`).

* Fixed a bug in Django 5.0 that caused a crash of ``Model.full_clean()`` on
  models with a ``GeneratedField`` (:ticket:`35127`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 that caused a crash of
  ``FilteredRelation()`` with querysets as right-hand sides (:ticket:`35135`).
  ``FilteredRelation()`` now raises a ``ValueError`` on querysets as right-hand
  sides.

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 that caused a crash of the ``dumpdata``
  management command when a base queryset used ``prefetch_related()``
  (:ticket:`35159`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 that caused the ``request_finished`` signal to
  sometimes not be fired when running Django through an ASGI server, resulting
  in potential resource leaks (:ticket:`35059`).
